                Imran Khan entered politics in the mid-1990s, forming the political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 1996. <br>
                Initially, PTI struggled to gain significant electoral success but gradually became a prominent force in Pakistani <br>politics, especially among the youth.
                <h2>Political Career:</h2>

                His tenure as Prime Minister focused on <br>addressing corruption, improving governance, and implementing socio-economic reforms.
                However, his <br>government faced challenges, including economic difficulties, opposition criticism, and foreign policy complexities. <br>
                Khan's leadership style, charisma, and determination to bring change to Pakistan's political landscape marked his tenure.

                His tenure as Prime Minister ended in April 2022, and he continued to be a prominent figure in Pakistani politics <br>thereafter.
                Throughout his life, Imran Khan has been a polarizing figure, admired by many for his achievements in <br>cricket and philanthropy, while also facing criticism and scrutiny for his political decisions and governance style.
